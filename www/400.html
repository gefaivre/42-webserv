<!-- 
	* In case of a headers too long *
	In the header of the client, the request is defined. It may happen that the server 
	has set a limit regarding the header length. If the header exceeds the server's set 
	limit - i.e. it is too long - a 400 Bad Request may occur.

	* in case of a file size limit *
	The server can set a file size limit in addition to the header limit. 
	If you want to upload particularly large files, the server may refuse 
	to accept them, leading to the 400 Bad Request error message.
